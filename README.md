### UOTTAHACK2018 RL Systems Hacking Challenge
  A multidevice app created to perform Client/Admin tasks based on the login commands which need to be dispatched. Once the client information has been submitted then a push notification is release which informs the client the waiting time he needs to know in order to proceed to the Doctors walk-in hours.This communicates with a firebase app server by sending a message on to the firebase database. There is a function running on the server listening for updates to database information. When there is a new entry in the RequestApprove data a notification is sent to the admin. Once the admin approves the request the wait time begins for the admin.
